# Compiler

## Objective
    - Design a compiler in 7 stages written first in C++ and then in C#
    - Impliment using a FSM

## TODO
    1. Lexical Analyzer
        - Create state mechanism
        - State transfer definitions
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.
    6.
    7.

## Done
    1. Lexical Analyzer
        - Basic functions for helper.h including file reading
        - Use map to store output before written to file
    2.

    6.
    7.

## File Layout
    - CPP (Compiler written in C++)
        - CompilerCPP
            - Helper.h
                - basic functions to help during state management
            - StateMechanism.h
                - handle state and state transition definitions
            - CompilerCPP.cpp
                - implement Helper.h and StateMechanism to input and write to file
    - CS 
        - Compiler written in C# after CPP
